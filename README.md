# **Numina — AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant**

## **📘 Project Overview**

Numina is designed to help users understand personal spending habits, improve financial literacy, and receive guidance through an AI-driven conversational interface. Built using **Next.js, React, Tailwind, and TypeScript**, the system incorporates IBM watsonx Assistant to provide context-aware reasoning and financial explanations in real time.

Our project focuses on creating a foundation for an intelligent personal finance platform while demonstrating mastery of AI orchestration and IBM cloud services.

## **🧠 Use of Agentic AI & IBM watsonx**

A key requirement of the IBM program was the integration of AI in a meaningful, application-driven way.
Numina embeds **IBM watsonx Assistant** as its central conversational engine.

Through watsonx Assistant, Numina can:

* Interpret user questions about personal finance topics
* Engage in multi-turn, context-sensitive conversations
* Provide structured, educational explanations
* Guide users through budgeting, savings concepts, and spending behavior

This integration allowed our team to apply concepts from the IBM bootcamp, such as prompt design, agentic behavior, intent handling, context variables, and conversational planning.

We also prepared Numina for future integration with **watsonx Generative AI** models for automated financial insights and data-driven reasoning.

## **☁️ IBM Cloud Integration (Planned)**

As part of our future expansion roadmap, we plan to deploy Numina to **IBM Cloud Engine** for:

* Scalable hosting of the Next.js application
* Backend API support
* Secure handling of user session data
* Integration with watsonx Generative AI APIs

This aligns with IBM Cloud best practices and the cloud-native development models taught in the course.

## **💳 Planned Financial Data Integration (Plaid)**

Although out of scope for the bootcamp timeline, our extended project roadmap includes integrating **Plaid**, which will allow users to securely link bank accounts and enable:

* Automatic import of transaction history
* Categorization and analysis of spending
* Personalized financial insights for the AI assistant

This demonstrates how we plan to evolve Numina beyond a prototype into a complete intelligent finance system.
